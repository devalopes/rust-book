    // Lifetime ellisons
    // lifetime rules inserted automatically by the compiler
    /*
    * The first rule is that each parameter that is a reference gets its own lifetime parameter. In other words, a function with one parameter gets one lifetime parameter: fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32); a function with two parameters gets two separate lifetime parameters: fn foo<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32); and so on.
    * The second rule is if there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, that lifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameters: fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32) -> &'a i32.
    * The third rule is if there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but one of them is &self or &mut self because this is a method, the lifetime of self is assigned to all output lifetime parameters. This third rule makes methods much nicer to read and write because fewer symbols are necessary.

    // The static lifetime
    // Special rule 'static meaning reference can live forever (string literals)

    // The text of this string is stored directly in the programâ€™s binary, which is always available. Therefore, the lifetime of all string literals is 'static.
    let s: &'static str = "I have a static lifetime.";
